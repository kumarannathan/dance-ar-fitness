# Milestone 2: Pose Detection & Scoring Implementation

## Overview

In this milestone, we've made significant progress in implementing real-time pose detection and scoring capabilities for our AR dance fitness application. Building upon the foundation established in Milestone 1, we've integrated MediaPipe's pose detection system and developed a sophisticated scoring mechanism.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Pose Detection Implementation

We've successfully integrated MediaPipe's PoseLandmarker for real-time body landmark detection. This system:
- Tracks 33 key body points in real-time
- Provides accurate joint position data
- Works with both video and camera feeds
- Maintains high performance across different devices

### 2. Scoring System

Our new scoring system provides immediate feedback on pose accuracy:
- Compares user poses to reference poses in real-time
- Calculates similarity scores based on joint positions
- Provides visual feedback through color-coded indicators
- Tracks progress and maintains high scores

### 3. Beta Dance Battle Feature

We've introduced a new feature that allows users to:
- Upload dance videos for practice
- See real-time pose tracking visualization
- Receive immediate feedback on pose accuracy
- Track their progress through scoring

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

The user interface has been significantly improved:
- Split-screen layout for video and camera feeds
- Real-time pose visualization
- Color-coded feedback for pose accuracy
- Intuitive controls for video playback

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented efficient pose detection algorithms
- Optimized video processing for smooth playback
- Enhanced error handling and recovery
- Improved data synchronization between components

### Code Architecture
- Modular design for pose detection and scoring
- Clean separation of concerns
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Accurate Pose Detection
**Solution**: Implemented multiple validation checks and confidence thresholds to ensure reliable pose detection.

### Challenge 2: Real-time Scoring
**Solution**: Developed an efficient scoring algorithm that maintains performance while providing accurate feedback.

### Challenge 3: Video Synchronization
**Solution**: Created a robust video handling system with proper event management and error recovery.

## Next Steps

For Milestone 3, we plan to:
1. Expand the dance routine library
2. Implement social features for sharing scores
3. Add more advanced pose matching algorithms
4. Enhance the user experience with additional feedback mechanisms
